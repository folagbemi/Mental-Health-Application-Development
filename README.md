# Mental-Health-Application-Development-for-Young-Adults-in-Nigeria
### Problem Statement:
The young adult population in Nigeria is significantly impacted by mental health challenges, affecting their overall well-being and impeding their personal and professional growth. High rates of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, PTSD, and schizophrenia, coupled with inadequate access to information and care, exacerbate this issue. Societal stigma, cultural beliefs, and discrimination further hinder understanding and access to treatment, leaving young adults without readily available resources and therapists.

### Project Goal
The goal of this project was to develop an innovative platform/application providing comprehensive information, resources, and anonymous access to mental health professionals. This solution aimed to help young adults cope with mental health challenges, ultimately improving their well-being and professional growth.

## Research and Analysis
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 50 million Nigerians suffer from some form of mental disorder, with Nigeria having the highest caseload of depression in Africa and ranking 15th globally in suicide frequency. This data underscored the urgent need for accessible mental health resources.

### Development Process
1. **Market Research**: Conducted a thorough analysis of existing mental health applications, identifying features that could be integrated or improved upon in our platform.
   
2. **Team Collaboration**: Shared findings with the team, sparking discussions and generating additional feature ideas for the mobile app.

3. **User Persona Creation**: Developed detailed user personas to understand the target audience's needs and challenges better.

4. **Wireframe Design**: As the UI/UX designer, led the creation of wireframes despite initial skill limitations. With determination and team support, improved Figma skills, conducted multiple feedback sessions, and iterated on designs.

5. **Prototyping**: Finalized wireframes and created interactive prototypes, ensuring the app was user-friendly and effectively addressed the identified mental health challenges.

IF wireframes, there are digital images of 6 screens, each with at least 1 navigation indicator, 1 element, and 1 annotation.
